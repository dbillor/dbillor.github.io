    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>A versatile technical leader with a career spanning almost every layer of networking—from hands‑on hardware and optical network design, through software‑defined automation and workflow optimization, to orchestrating end‑to‑end systems at cloud scale. This unique depth and breadth of expertise enables the creation of highly efficient, reliable, and high‑performing networks that meet and anticipate the demands of today’s AI‑driven workloads. Leveraging deep domain knowledge and an innovative mindset, I excel at integrating emerging technologies—such as LLM‑driven operations—into the entire networking stack. My track record includes driving significant reliability improvements, building scalable automation frameworks, and guiding multidisciplinary teams to deliver next‑generation infrastructures. I have experience in IP routing and Optical networks.</p>
